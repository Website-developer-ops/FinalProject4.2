            <h2>What Are Anabolic Steroids?</h2>
            <p>
                Anabolic-Androgenic Steroids (AAS) are synthetic derivatives of testosterone, the male sex hormone. In the fitness world, they’re commonly used to enhance muscle growth, performance, and recovery. However, their use comes with serious risks.

            <h2>Common Steroids & Performance Enhancing Drugs (PEDs)</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Testosterone Enanthate/Cypionate:</strong> Base steroid used for bulking. Mimics natural testosterone.</li>
                <li><strong>Dianabol (Methandrostenolone):</strong> Fast-acting oral steroid for mass gain.</li>
                <li><strong>Trenbolone:</strong> Potent steroid for muscle hardening and fat loss. Highly androgenic.</li>
                <li><strong>Anavar (Oxandrolone):</strong> Mild oral steroid often used in cutting phases, popular with beginners.</li>
                <li><strong>Winstrol (Stanozolol):</strong> Known for promoting a dry, hard look. Often used pre-contest.</li>
                <li><strong>HGH (Human Growth Hormone):</strong> Not a steroid but often used alongside AAS to promote recovery and lean tissue growth.</li>
                <li><strong>Insulin and IGF-1:</strong> Advanced compounds used to increase nutrient uptake and growth. Very risky without proper knowledge.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Pros of Using Steroids in Bodybuilding</h2>
            <p>
                While controversial, steroids are used by some athletes and bodybuilders for the following benefits:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased muscle mass and strength in a shorter period</li>
                <li>Enhanced recovery between workouts</li>
                <li>Improved protein synthesis and nitrogen retention</li>
                <li>Reduced fatigue and increased training intensity</li>
                <li>Improved muscle hardness and vascularity (especially during cutting)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Risks and Side Effects</h2>
            <p>
                The use of steroids can lead to serious health consequences, especially when abused or used without medical supervision:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Liver toxicity (especially with oral steroids)</li>
                <li>Hormonal imbalances (testosterone suppression)</li>
                <li>Gynecomastia (development of breast tissue in males)</li>
                <li>Acne, oily skin, hair loss (especially with DHT-based steroids)</li>
                <li>Cardiovascular issues: high blood pressure, increased LDL cholesterol</li>
                <li>Psychological effects: aggression, mood swings, anxiety</li>
                <li>Dependency and withdrawal symptoms</li>

            <h2>Post Cycle Therapy (PCT)</h2>
            <p>
                PCT is critical after a steroid cycle to help restore natural hormone production. Common PCT drugs include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Clomid (Clomiphene Citrate):</strong> Stimulates LH and FSH to restart testosterone production</li>
                <li><strong>Nolvadex (Tamoxifen):</strong> Helps prevent estrogen-related side effects and restores hormonal balance</li>
                <li><strong>Aromatase Inhibitors (AIs):</strong> Like Arimidex, used to control estrogen levels during or after cycle</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Mitigate Side Effects (If One Chooses to Use)</h2>
            <p>
                While the safest route is staying natural, some users choose to experiment. In that case:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Get blood work before, during, and after cycles</li>
                <li>Use liver support supplements (like milk thistle, NAC)</li>
                <li>Stay hydrated and monitor blood pressure</li>
                <li>Limit cycles (e.g. 8–12 weeks max) and take sufficient time off</li>
                <li>Include proper PCT every time</li>
                <li>Avoid stacking multiple harsh compounds without research</li>
            </ul>
